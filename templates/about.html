            <div id="collapseOne" class="accordion-collapse collapse show" data-bs-parent="#aboutAccordion"><div class="accordion-body">Warfarin is a highly effective anticoagulant, but its optimal dose varies dramatically between individuals. A dose that is therapeutic for one patient can be dangerous for another. This variability is largely influenced by a person's clinical factors (like age and weight) and their unique genetic makeup.</div></div>

            <div id="collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#aboutAccordion"><div class="accordion-body">Our system uses a powerful machine learning model called a <strong>Random Forest Regressor</strong>. It has been trained on thousands of patient records to learn the complex, non-linear relationships between patient characteristics and the correct Warfarin dose. It operates in two modes: a <strong>Base Model</strong> for when only clinical data is available, and an <strong>Enhanced Model</strong> that incorporates genetic information from the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes for superior accuracy.</div></div>

            <div id="collapseThree" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#aboutAccordion"><div class="accordion-body">For a clinician to trust an AI's recommendation, they need to understand its reasoning. Our tool integrates a state-of-the-art technique called <strong>SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)</strong>. For every prediction, SHAP calculates the exact impact of each patient featureâ€”quantifying how much factors like age, weight, or a specific genetic variant pushed the dosage recommendation up or down. This transparency transforms our model from a "black box" into a trustworthy decision-support tool.</div></div>
